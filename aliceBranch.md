# Things I've done in this branch

- add a Random Generator to RandomPlayer and GreedyPlayer to generate RandomInteger and test them (**TEST DOUBLE**)

- create the test for RandomPlayer

- added tests for Position (**very simple tests but we are in a TTD approach**)

- modified ctor of CommandLine game (**SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE**)

- moved getPointsAndResetAllStonesDead() to Board -> set setAllStonesDead to private (**kind of FEATURE ENVY**)

- moved getMaximumNumberOfStonesInARow() to Board -> set countStonesInRow to private (**kind of FEATURE ENVY**)
